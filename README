Java::JCR
---------

"JCR" is a shorthand for Content Repository API for the Java Specification API.
This is a hierarchical database API written for Java. 

I'm in the process of writing a similar API for Perl (see Repository::Simple),
but I'm getting a little impatient and wanted something usable right now.
Therefore, I used Inline::Java and some custom scripting to build a direct API
port from the JCR and added the tools necessary to create and use a Jackrabbit
repository.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, I recommend the following
resources:

Installation
------------

Installation can be a bit tricky because this library depends upon Inline::Java,
which didn't install without going through the process by hand. (I usually just
let CPAN do all the work.) You must first install Inline::Java. 

Then, you must install libwww-perl, as I use that to download the Jar files. I
hope to remove this dependency in the future, but it's there for now.

After installing both of those, you should be able to run:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

I generally try to make my build scripts as standard as possible. If you prefer
using make, I have Module::Build distributing a makefile generator too:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
